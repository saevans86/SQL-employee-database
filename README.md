# Title 
## SQL-employee-manager



- My motivation for this project was to learn as much as SQL as possible for this project, needless to say I did learn quite a bit, but still need a lot more time getting to know inserts/updates etc. I definitely learned a lot about nesting functions as well as async functions and how they work. 

- My reason for building this project was to dig into database management with a clean and effective app, that can serve as a tool for building, editing and managing larger and more complex databases. Some features that would be beneficial to this app would be a HTML page structure so that it could serve a greater audience. 

- Some of the issues I initially faced was trying to implement too many things at once. My plan was to find a way to edit an employee with using routes and query, but they somewhat serve the same purpose, and the previous assignments were completed using routes, so working a newer and less familiar method was beneficial especially since its primary function is querying the database.

- Now that I've come to what is considered completed, I would still really like to implement more functions, such as the previously mentioned web interface for user friendliness, as well as the ability to edit more information of the DB than just the role, such as employee name/last name, and work in a more complex database structure..
